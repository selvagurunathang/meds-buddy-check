## üõ†Ô∏è Supabase Integration

### 1. **Authentication**
- Uses [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth) for secure user sign up, login, and password reset.
- Session state is managed in the app, with auto-logout after inactivity.

### 2. **Database (CRUD Operations)**
- Medications and medication logs are stored in Supabase Postgres tables.
- All CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for medications are performed using the Supabase client.
- Real-time updates are enabled using Supabase‚Äôs real-time subscriptions, so changes are reflected instantly in the UI.

**Example Supabase usage:**
```ts
// src/lib/supabase.ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
const supabaseAnonKey = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);
```
